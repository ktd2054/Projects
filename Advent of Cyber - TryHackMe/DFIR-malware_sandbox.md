# TryHackMe - AoC - Malware Sandbox

- Analysing .exe file using PeStudio as a part of DFIR.

### Static Analysis

- For static analysis, is used to gather information about a malware without executing it and digging deep.

  The informations to be gathered from static anlaysis are:

  - Checksums: to track and catalogue files and execuatbles.
  - Strings: for IP addresses, URLs, commands or passwords.
  - Imports: are list of libararies and function that the application depends upon.
  - Resources: has data as an icon displayed to user as a part of tricy act by malware to hide itself inside the icon.

  Loading the executable file in PeStudio and first step is to analyse sha256, a checksum, an unique identifier for the executable. This sha can be kept as a note of threat intelligence.

  Step 2 is to review strings of the executable. 

### Dynamic Analysis

- For dynamic analysis, we need to execute the file to identify its behaviours and how it interacts with the operating system.

#### Regshot

- to analyse malware on windows which creates two snapshots of the registry before and after running the malware and they are compared to identify any changes.

#### ProcMon

- to monitor and investiagte how processes are interacting with windows operating system.
