# IoT Traffic Monitoring and Anomaly Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements an **IoT network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection system** using **Contiki-NG** and the **COOJA simulator**.  
Unlike traditional signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), this solution combines **rule-based thresholds** with **lightweight machine learning** to detect unusual network activity in real time.

The simulated environment models:
- **Normal Nodes** â€“ Send regular sensor data
- **Attack Nodes** â€“ Simulate malicious activity (e.g., DoS, spoofing)
- **Sink Node** â€“ Aggregates all traffic and performs anomaly detection

The system is designed for **scalability, low computational cost, and deployability** in real-world IoT scenarios such as **smart cities, healthcare, and industrial IoT**.
