# 🛡️ Malicious Web Traffic Analysis (Wireshark PCAP Investigation)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a **real-world SOC investigation** where a user downloaded a malicious file after interacting with a deceptive web result. Using **packet capture (PCAP) analysis only**, I investigated the network traffic to **confirm infection, identify malicious activity, and extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**.

The analysis was performed **safely** using publicly available PCAP files without executing any malware.

## 🎯 Objectives
Through this project, I demonstrate my ability to:

- Analyze **real-world malicious web traffic** using Wireshark
- Identify suspicious **HTTP requests and payload downloads**
- Detect **malicious redirects and fake software delivery**
- Extract and document **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**
- Correlate traffic with **open-source threat intelligence**
- Write a **SOC-style incident report**

## 🔐 Safety & Lab Rules
✔ PCAP analysis only  
✔ No malware execution  
✔ No binary extraction  
✔ Analysis performed inside isolated VM  
✔ Read-only inspection of network traffic
