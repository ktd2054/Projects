- ✅ Verify that the Nessus service is running by executing:  
  `sudo /bin/systemctl status nessusd.service`  
  The service status should show **🟢 active (running)**

- 🌐 Open a web browser and navigate to:  
  `https://localhost:8834`
- ⚠️ Accept the browser security warning to proceed  
- ➡️ Click **Continue** and select **Nessus Professional**  
- 📧 Complete the setup using your email address

## 🖥️ Setting up VMS

Virtual machines are configured on a small internal network to enable communication and vulnerability scanning.  
All systems are placed within the **same IP address range** to ensure proper connectivity.

### 🧱 Lab Environment

- 🟦 **Domain Server Controller:** DC01  
- 🌐 **Web Server:** Web01  
- 🐧 **Linux Machine:** Kali01  
- 🪟 **Windows 11 Client:** Win11  
- 🖥️ **Windows Server 2025:** WinS2025

## ⚙️ Setting up Scanning Policy

- 🧭 To perform vulnerability scans, a scanning policy must be configured  
- 📂 Navigate to **Resources → Policies** from the Nessus sidebar  
- 📋 Review the available policies and select or customise one based on scanning requirements  
- 🔐 Credentialed scans require valid domain user accounts  

---

## 👤 Setting up users to perform credentials scan

- ➕ Create a new user account on the domain controller **DC01**

- 🔑 Configure the same user as a **local administrator** on other systems such as  
  **Web01, Win11, and additional machines**  
- 🛡️ Grant the user administrative privileges by adding it to the  
  **Domain Admins** group on **DC01**  

✅ This configuration enables Nessus to perform authenticated scans and collect detailed system information.
