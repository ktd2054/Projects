# Welcome to Projects !

I have done few mini projects to gain hands-on experience.

## College mini projects

- IoT Network Traffic & Anomaly Detection (Cooja)
Built a simulated IoT network in the Cooja emulator, captured traffic and implemented simple anomaly detection. Focus: identifying unusual device behaviour (scanning, traffic spikes). Tools/skills: Contiki/Cooja, pcap analysis. Simulated IoT environment and developed anomaly-detection rules to flag malicious traffic patterns.

- WordPress Security Improvement (XSS, hardening, SQLi)
Audited a WordPress site for common web vulnerabilities, implemented fixes (input sanitisation, CSP, secure config, least-privilege DB user), and tested against XSS/SQLi. Tools/skills: Burp/OWASP ZAP, WP hardening best-practices, PHP sanitisation, secure plugins/config. Performed vulnerability remediation and hardening for WordPress, reducing common web risks (XSS/SQLi).

- Java Quiz App (Simple quiz app)
A CRUD-capable desktop/mobile Java quiz application with question management, scoring, and basic persistence (files/DB). Focus: UI, input validation and program flow. Tools/skills: Java, JDBC or file I/O. Developed a Java quiz application with question management and scoring logic.

## SOC lab projects

- Home Lab (real-life VMs & malware bazaar)
Built an on-prem SOC lab with multiple VMs (Windows/Linux), logging (syslog/ELK/Splunk), and safe malware samples from malware-bazaar for detection practice. Focus: playbook testing, containment. Tools/skills: VMs, Splunk/ELK, network monitoring. Constructed a multi-VM SOC lab to develop detection rules and practice incident response using real samples.

- Practical Labs (TryHackMe-based SOC exercises)
Completed hands-on TryHackMe rooms focused on SOC tasks — log analysis, threat hunting, network forensics, and incident triage. Focus: applying L1/L2 analyst workflows and writing reports. Tools/skills: Splunk/ELK queries, PCAP analysis, Windows forensics basics. Executed practical SOC scenarios (triage, hunting, forensics) using TryHackMe labs to build analyst skillset.

- TryHackMe Simulator (Phishing simulator)
Built/configured a phishing simulation environment to test user awareness and incident detection — created realistic templates, tracked click rates, and integrated simulated alerts for SOC ingestion. Focus: social-engineering testing and alert validation. Tools/skills: phishing frameworks/simulators, SMTP/web templates, alerting pipelines. Deployed a phishing simulator to measure user susceptibility and validate alerting/response processes.
