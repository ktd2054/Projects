Welcome !!! 

This SOC Lab repository is organised into three key sections:

- HOME_LAB: Windows/Linux security projects and monitoring tasks performed in my virtual environment.

- Practical Labs: Hands-on exercises completed through TryHackMe to reinforce SOC fundamentals.

- Phishing Simulator: Analysis of SOC alerts generated from TryHackMe’s Phishing Simulation scenarios.

Together, these folders showcase my practical experience across log analysis, threat detection, and incident investigation.
