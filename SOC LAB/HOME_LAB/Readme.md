### Welcome to hands-on journey to becoming a SOC Analyst!

Feeling overwhelmed, but the path forward is clear: build practical skills. This is a series of short, powerful projects done to get the exact experience hiring managers are looking for.

The HOME_LAB directory contains hands-on cybersecurity projects built within my virtual environment. 

It includes foundational SOC analysis tasks such as network traffic investigation, Windows log monitoring, SIEM exploration, and introductory Splunk workflows. 

Each project is designed to mirror real SOC responsibilities and strengthen practical detection, analysis, and troubleshooting skills.
