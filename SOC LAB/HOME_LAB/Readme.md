### Welcome to hands-on journey to becoming a SOC Analyst!

Feeling overwhelmed, but the path forward is clear: build practical skills. This is a series of short, powerful projects done to get the exact experience hiring managers are looking for.

I will start by building my own virtual cyber lab, then dive into real-world scenarios:

- Hunt threats in network traffic with Wireshark.

- Write detection rules in a SIEM like Splunk.

- Safely analyze malware to uncover its secrets.

By completing and documenting these projects, I will learn and create a portfolio.
