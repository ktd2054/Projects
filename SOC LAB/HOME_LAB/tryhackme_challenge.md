# Perimeter Logs: Investigating a Breach

This section falls under Network Security Essentials from TryHackMe. This is a challenge hands-on lab given to learners. 

### Incident Scenario

Initech Corp, a mid-sized financial services company, has recently deployed a new firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS) to monitor its network perimeter. Over the past month, security analysts have noticed abnormal traffic patterns, but the SOC team has been overwhelmed and missed deeper analysis.

As a new security analyst, you have been tasked with reviewing one month of perimeter logs to determine what techniques the adversary used, and whether they succeeded in breaching the perimeter.

You have been given three sets of logs from the time of the incident. The logs can be found in the Perimeter_logs/challenge directory on the Desktop.

- Firewall Logs:firewall.log

- WAF Logs:ids_alerts.log 

- VPN Logs:vpn_auth.log
