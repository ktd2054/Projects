# TRYHACKME: PHISHING UNFOLDING LAB

Welcome to Phishing Lab Simulator experience using tryhackme.com

### Dashboard

As I entered the SOC Simulator on TryHackMe, I noticed several key sections. The Dashboard displayed all alerts, including open and closed ones. There was a SIEM tool for event monitoring and analysis, a virtual machine named Analyst VM for hands-on investigation, as well as sections for documentation, playbooks, and a case report list for tracking and reporting incidents.
