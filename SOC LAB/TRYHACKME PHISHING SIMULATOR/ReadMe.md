# TRYHACKME: PHISHING UNFOLDING LAB

The TRYHACKME PHISHING SIMULATOR directory contains completed SOC alert investigations generated from TryHackMe’s phishing simulation environment. 

These analyses cover email threat identification, malicious indicators, user-behaviour patterns, and alert triage workflows.

Each write-up demonstrates practical SOC investigation skills, from reviewing suspicious emails to validating indicators and determining the appropriate response actions.


### Dashboard

As I entered the SOC Simulator on TryHackMe, I noticed several key sections. The Dashboard displayed all alerts, including open and closed ones. There was a SIEM tool for event monitoring and analysis, a virtual machine named Analyst VM for hands-on investigation, as well as sections for documentation, playbooks, and a case report list for tracking and reporting incidents.

When I redirect myself towards Documentation Section, it leads towards company information and the tools that we are going to use in this lab.
