# Practical Labs

The Practical Labs directory contains hands-on cybersecurity exercises completed through the TryHackMe SOC Level 1 pathway. 

These labs focus on real-world skills such as log analysis, basic SIEM investigations, malware examination, and vulnerability assessment.

Each write-up documents the workflow, tools used, and analytical steps taken to solve SOC-style challenges.
