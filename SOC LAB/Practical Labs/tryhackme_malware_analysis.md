# TryHackMe: Shadow Trace

It’s the middle of the night shift. You’re the only analyst in the SOC when a manager calls in urgently: a suspicious file was found on a user's machine and needs immediate review.
You open the file and start digging. Something doesn’t look normal for a company updater, and at the same time, the EDR throws a couple of alerts.
Your task: analyse the file, collect anything to identify it, gather any potential IOCs, correlate and analyse the alerts for potential malicious behaviour. 
It’s up to you to piece together what’s happening before it spreads further.

Analyse the binary located C:\Users\DFIRUser\Desktop\windows-update.exe in the attached machine, answer the questions below. 
Start the lab by clicking the Start Machine button. It will take around 2 minutes to load properly. The VM will be accessible on the right side of the split screen.
You can find several tools installed in the machine that can help you with any kind of analysis under C:\Users\DFIRUser\DFIR Tools

#### Lab
1) What is the architecture of the binary file windows-update.exe?

Let's check file first using "dir" command in cmd. After verifying the file lets use Sysinternals command to check the architecture of .exe file. 
<i> sigcheck C:\Users\DFIRUser\Desktop\windows-update.exe </i>

2) What is the hash (sha-256) of the file windows-update.exe?

I used certuil command to check sha256 hash of the given file. 
<i> certutil -hashfile C:\Users\DFIRUser\Desktop\windows-update.exe SHA256 </i>
