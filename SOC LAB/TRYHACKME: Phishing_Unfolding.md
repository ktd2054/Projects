# TRYHACKME: PHISHING UNFOLDING LAB

### Dashboard

As I entered the SOC Simulator on TryHackMe, I noticed several key sections. The Dashboard displayed all alerts, including open and closed ones. There was a SIEM tool for event monitoring and analysis, a virtual machine named Analyst VM for hands-on investigation, as well as sections for documentation, playbooks, and a case report list for tracking and reporting incidents.

### Alert Queue

When I clicked on Alert Queue in the sidebar, I was redirected to a list of all current alerts on the system. An interesting observation was that each alert displayed its type (for example, phishing or process-related) and its severity level (such as low or high), which helps determine the criticality of the alert and prioritize response efforts.
