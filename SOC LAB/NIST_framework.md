# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 – Complete Notes for SOC Analysts
The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0** is an updated version of the widely adopted CSF
1.1.
It provides guidelines for organizations to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk, structured into clear
functional areas.--
# **1. Purpose of NIST CSF 2.0**
NIST CSF 2.0 helps organizations:- Identify cybersecurity risks- Build structured security programs- Improve SOC and IR processes- Integrate governance and risk management- Align cybersecurity with business objectives
NIST CSF 2.0 is flexible and used by organizations of all sizes.--
# **2. Updated Structure of NIST CSF 2.0**
NIST CSF 2.0 introduces **six core functions** (previously five):
1. **Govern** (NEW in 2.0)
2. **Identify**
3. **Protect**
4. **Detect**
5. **Respond**
6. **Recover**
Each function contains **categories** and **subcategories** describing specific cybersecurity
outcomes.--
# **3. Function 1: GOVERN (GV) – New in CSF 2.0**
The Govern function ensures cybersecurity is aligned with organizational strategy and risk
management.
### Key Topics:- Risk management strategy- Roles, responsibilities, and reporting lines- Supply chain risk management- Policy and oversight
### Examples:- Establishing a cybersecurity governance committee- Defining SOC responsibilities and escalation paths- Ensuring vendors follow security standards--
# **4. Function 2: IDENTIFY (ID)**
Organizations must understand their environment, assets, risks, and overall security posture.
### Categories:- Asset Management- Risk Assessment- Business Environment- Vulnerability Identification
### Examples:- Maintaining asset inventory- Identifying critical systems- Conducting regular risk assessments--
# **5. Function 3: PROTECT (PR)**
Measures to safeguard systems and reduce the likelihood of attacks.
### Categories:
- Access Control- Data Security- Awareness & Training- Endpoint and Network Protection- Secure Configuration
### Examples:- MFA enforcement- Patch management- Data encryption- User security training--
# **6. Function 4: DETECT (DE)**
Rapid detection of cybersecurity events through monitoring and alerting.
### Categories:- Anomalies and Events- Continuous Monitoring- Detection Processes
### Examples:- SIEM monitoring (Splunk)- IDS/IPS alerts- SOC triage workflow- Endpoint detection rules--
# **7. Function 5: RESPOND (RS)**
Actions taken once a cybersecurity incident is confirmed.
### Categories:- Incident response planning
- Communication- Analysis- Mitigation- Containment
### Examples:- Activating the IR plan- Containing infected hosts- Communicating with stakeholders- Using MITRE ATT&CK; for analysis--
# **8. Function 6: RECOVER (RC)**
Restoring normal operations after an incident.
### Categories:- Recovery planning- Improvements- Communication
### Examples:- Restoring systems from backups- Conducting lessons learned meetings- Updating IR plans and detection rules--
# **9. What’s New in NIST CSF 2.0?**
### 
 New Core Function: **Govern**
Brings cybersecurity into organizational decision making.
### 
 Expanded Supply Chain Security
Focus on third-party risks.
### 
 Updated Implementation Tiers
Tier levels describe how advanced an organization's security posture is.
### 
 Profiles for Customization
Profiles help organizations tailor CSF to their size, industry, and maturity.--
# **10. How SOC Analysts Benefit from NIST CSF 2.0**- Understand organizational risk strategy- Improve detection coverage and IR workflows- Align SOC reporting with global standards- Ensure compliance with governance requirements- Enhance maturity scoring and roadmap planning--
# **11. Quick Summary Table**
| Function | Purpose | SOC Relevance |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **GV** Govern | Strategic direction, policies | SOC roles, IR policies, reporting |
| **ID** Identify | Understand risks, assets | Risk assessment, asset inventory |
| **PR** Protect | Reduce attack likelihood | Hardening, patching, access control |
| **DE** Detect | Find attacks quickly | SIEM, EDR, log monitoring |
| **RS** Respond | Contain & eradicate threats | IR process, forensics |
| **RC** Recover | Return to operations | Restore services, lessons learned
